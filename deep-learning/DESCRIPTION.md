Welcome to Deep Learning!
This module will be an introduction to the world of deep learning.
The goal of this module is to introduce you to what neural networks are, how they work, and how you can use them.


Deep learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that mimics the human brain's structure and function to recognize patterns in data.
It relies on neural networks, which are made up of layers of interconnected nodes (or neurons) that process and learn from vast amounts of data.
By using multiple layers (hence "deep"), deep learning models can automatically learn complex features and representations from raw inputs, such as images, text, or sounds, without requiring manual feature extraction.


There are many types of neural networks, but the one that we will cover in this module is called a Feedforward Neural Network.
In this type of neural network, information moves in one direction, from input to output, passing through hidden layers.


Some other types of neural networks include:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
    - Used for image processing tasks such as object detection, image classification, and facial recognition
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
    - Used for time series forecasting, speech recognition, and text generation
- Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)
    - Type of RNN that handles long-term dependecies better
    - Used for speech recognition, text generation
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
    - Consists of two neural networks (a generator and a discriminator) that compete against each other. The generator creates data, and the discriminator evaluates it.
    - Used for image generation, deepfake creation, data augmentation
- Transformer Networks
    - Used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks like translation, text generation (like ChatGPT), and speech recognition

While not covered in this module, these networks might be covered modules added in the future.
